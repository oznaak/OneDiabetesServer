# OneDiabetes 
This project was dropped due to discovery of NightScout i no longer need to keep developing OneDiabetes as the purpose of it's development is already fullfilled.
So far this is the backend, but it's missing an important step which is to first verify user's server cause it is currenltly hard coded to work with eu2.
This project was the back-end to a React Native App meant to connect with LibreLinkUP Api in order to display glucose readings from the FreeStyle Libre Sensor.
